      <h1>Batch video compression</h1>
      <p>All consumer cameras record videos that can be compressed 2x without a visible loss of quality.
        This happens because effective video encoding takes a lot of time and computing power while most
        cameras have to record real-time and conserve battery.</p>
      <p>Make sure you already have <a href="https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/#download-ffmpeg">ffmpeg installed</a>.</p>
      <p>On an average desktop, this operation takes 1-2x of the video run time e.g. a 30s video will take
        a minute to process.</p>
      <p>Pick a folder on your computer and this app will find all MP4 videos and process them one-by-one.</p>
      <p>Metadata and file creation, modification and access dates will be preserved where possible.</p>
